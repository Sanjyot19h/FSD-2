=React State Management Experiment

-This experiment demonstrates different state management approaches in React and their use cases in modern web applications.

-Local State (useState) is used for managing component-specific data that does not need to be shared globally.

-Context API provides a built-in way to manage global state and share data across the component tree without prop drilling.

-Redux is a predictable state container suitable for large and complex applications with frequent state updates and shared business logic.
